# Friends-of-Seaview-Pier-Membership-Program
Hello there,

This project is a simple membership & sponsorship program for an imaginary orginization called 'Friends of Seaview Pier'.

Friends of Seaview Pier is an organisation devoted to the restoration and upkeep of a pier in the town. 
A pier is a wooden structure that provides a walkway over the sea. 
The pier requires regular maintenance and the friends of the pier need to raise money for this purpose.
Members of Friends of Seaview Pier each pay $75 per year, as a contribution to the pier’s running costs.
This entitles them to free admission to the pier throughout the year. They can also volunteer to help run the
pier, by working at the pier entrance gate, working in the gift shop, or painting and decorating.
To provide additional income, the pier’s wooden planks can be sponsored. A brass plaque, which contains a short 
message of the sponsor’s choice, is fitted to a plank on the pier, for a donation of $200.
